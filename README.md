# Learning Swift Testing and XCTest

This repository is for my learning the new Swift Testing framework (using @Test, #expect, #require) in an Xcode project. It also includes a basic skeleton for UI tests using XCTest.

## Project Structure (Tests)
- OuluBankR1Tests (Swift Testing)
- OuluBankR1UITests (XCTest)

## Goals
- Learn Swift Testing syntax: @Test, #expect, #require, #require(Optional).
- Organize tests by feature/module.
- Understand when to use Swift Testing vs. XCTest (UI tests remain in XCTest).
